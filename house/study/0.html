		<h1>A Lounge</h1>
    <h4>
      A place of meticulous 
      research, comfortable solitude, 
      and comprehensive 
      information.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Sketchbooks filled with unruly 
      notes and equations with most of them x-ed over, a pencil 
      mug with a sea slug pattern filled entirely with fine
      -tip black dry erase markers, whiteboards with residue 
      from extensive usage, the sharp edges of a new laptop, graphs and charts
      with no labels so you pray 
      to the analysis gods to grant you an epiphany.

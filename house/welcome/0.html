    <h4>
      This is an about me gallery! It is styled in the form of a 
      series of rooms in a house, each with an abstract 
      description. Scattered in these descriptions are links in 
      bold, which take you to various creative works. Buttons on 
      the bottom of each page help navigate the site, and also 
      sometimes lead to external sites. In most of the rooms, 
      there is "about me" information below the room description.
      </br></br> This is heavily WIP, so most of the gallery has not
      yet been added!
